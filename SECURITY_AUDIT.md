# Weather App Security Audit

## Date: 2025-01-08

## Security Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Removed Hardcoded API Key from Release.xcconfig
- Changed from actual key to placeholder: `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
- Added warning comments about not committing real keys

### 2. ✅ Removed API Key from Documentation
- Updated `README_Vercel_Proxy.md` 
- Updated `vercel-proxy/README.md`
- Replaced actual key with generic instructions

### 3. ✅ Verified .gitignore Configuration
- `.xcconfig` files are already in `.gitignore` (lines 93-94)
- This prevents accidental commits of sensitive configuration

### 4. ✅ Verified Proxy Implementation
- App correctly uses `ProxyWeatherService` in production
- `ApiConfig.useProxy` returns `true` for Release builds
- WeatherViewModel properly switches between services

## Current Security Architecture

### Production (Release Build)
```
iOS App → ProxyWeatherService → Vercel Proxy → OpenWeatherMap API
```
- API key is stored on Vercel server
- Client never sees the actual API key

### Development (Debug Build)
```
iOS App → WeatherService → OpenWeatherMap API
```
- Uses obfuscated key for convenience
- Only for local development

## Remaining Issues

### NetworkManager (Not Used)
- `NetworkManager.swift` contains direct API usage
- This class is NOT used anywhere in the app
- Consider removing to avoid confusion

### API Key in Debug Mode
- `ApiConfig.swift` still contains obfuscated key for debug
- This is acceptable for development convenience
- Release builds will use proxy

## Deployment Instructions

Before uploading to App Store:

1. **Deploy Vercel Proxy**
   ```bash
   cd vercel-proxy
   vercel
   vercel env add OPENWEATHER_API_KEY production
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Update Proxy URL**
   - Edit `ApiConfig.swift`
   - Change `proxyBaseURL` to your actual Vercel URL

3. **Test Release Build**
   - Build with Release configuration
   - Verify it uses proxy (no direct API calls)

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit real API keys**
2. **Use environment variables in CI/CD**
3. **Always use proxy for production**
4. **Regularly rotate API keys**
5. **Monitor API usage for anomalies**

## Conclusion

The app is now secure for production deployment. The API key will not be exposed to end users when properly deployed with the Vercel proxy.
